Quantifying and understanding human-AI alignment in high-risk tasks such as traffic accident prediction is crucial for deployment of AI systems. Existing alignment studies, however, focus mostly on the static domain and neglect the importance of attentional processing. Here, we present Attention‑DADA, a dataset of accident and non-accident traffic situations that contains detailed human prediction and frame-level eye gaze annotations. Using this benchmark, we evaluate open- and closed-source, state‑of‑the‑art large vision-language-models (VLMs) in terms of their alignment in accident prediction performance and attentional processing in both zero-shot and attention-guided settings. Our results show that human prediction performance and consistency improve as the event time approaches. Similarly, human attentional patterns show dynamic updating throughout event progression. Conversely, while attention guidance improves VLM prediction performance, both performance and attentional alignment stay significantly below human levels as the event approaches, with the performance gap becoming significant 3.5 seconds (s) prior to the event. These results provide the first quantitative evidence of misalignment both in terms of performance and attentional processing during analysis of time-critical, dynamic events, highlighting the need for future improvements in this area.

## Significance
- ➡️ We present Attention-DADA, a benchmark for human-AI alignment in time-critical, high-risk traffic scenarios. 
- ➡️ On this dataset, VLMs show critical mis-alignment (“Late-Cue Gap”) starting 3.5s before event (such as accident)

<!-- ## Objective -->
<!-- Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not. -->


<!-- ## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm. -->
